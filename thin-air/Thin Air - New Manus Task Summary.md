## 🚨 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### If Manus Crashes

1. **Don't panic** - Checkpoints are saved
2. **Access last checkpoint** - Use checkpoint ID
3. **Start new task** - Load the checkpoint
4. **Continue from where it left off**

### If Tests Fail

Manus should:
1. Read error message
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run tests
4. If still failing after 3 attempts → Revert to last checkpoint
5. Try different approach

**If Manus doesn't do this → Tell it to revert**

### If You're Unsure

**Ask Manus:**
- "Explain what you just did"
- "Show me the code you wrote"
- "Why did you make this decision?"
- "What are the alternatives?"

**Manus should provide clear explanations**

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Tip 1: Be Patient

Building Thin Air properly takes 3-4 days. Don't rush.

### Tip 2: Verify Each Phase

Don't skip verification. Test everything before approving.

### Tip 3: Ask Questions

If anything is unclear, ask Manus to explain.

### Tip 4: Save Checkpoints

After every phase, ensure checkpoint is saved.

### Tip 5: Don't Add Features Mid-Build

Let Manus complete the core 5 modules first. Add features later.
