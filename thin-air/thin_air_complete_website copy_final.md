## THE PROBLEM (Act 1: Ordinary World)

### Section Headline:
**Your Best Ideas Are Stuck in Your Head**

You've had that idea for months. Maybe years.

The one that could streamline your operations. Cut costs. Finally give your team the tool they need—not another bloated software subscription that does everything *except* what you want.

But here's what actually happens:

Ideas arrive at 3 AM. During client calls. In the shower. You scribble them on napkins, type them into scattered notes apps, promise yourself you'll "organise this properly later."

Later never comes.

Because building software properly means:

- **Hiring developers** you can't afford ($50,000+ for even basic tools)
- **Learning to code** yourself (hundreds of hours you don't have)
- **Wrestling with "no-code" tools** that promise everything but constantly tell you "Sorry, that's not available on your plan" or "That integration isn't supported"

Sound familiar?

We built Thin Air because we lived this. Drowning in scattered ideas. Frustrated by endless limitations. Tired of watching good concepts die because they were "too complicated to build."

---

## THE GUIDE APPEARS (Act 2: The Solution)

### Section Headline:
**What If Your Ideas Could Just... Materialise?**

Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

We reckon he was onto something.

Not because technology *is* magic (it's not—it's maths and logic and a lot of clever engineering). But because when it works properly, it should *feel* effortless. Natural. Like your thoughts simply becoming real.

That's what Thin Air does.

Think about it: your ideas literally come out of thin air. A conversation. A napkin sketch. A rambling voice note recorded while driving. They're unstructured. Messy. Incomplete.

But they're valuable.

Thin Air takes those scattered thoughts—voice notes, sketches, rambling descriptions, PDF specifications—and transforms them into production-ready applications.

Not prototypes.  
Not mockups.  
Not "proof of concepts."

Actual working software. Built. Deployed temporarily for testing. Then downloaded completely so you can host it wherever you choose.

### How It's Different:

**Most "No-Code" Tools Say:**
- "You can't use that API"
- "That integration requires Enterprise"
- "You're locked into our hosting"
- "Want your code? That'll be extra"

**Thin Air Says:**
- "What do you want to build?"
- "Test it on our servers for 30 days"
- "Download everything—code, sites, documentation"
- "Host it wherever you want. It's yours"

---

## WHAT YOU GET

### Section Headline:
**Everything You Need. Nothing You Don't.**

When you build with Thin Air, you get:

### **Your Application**
Fully functional. Tested. Security-hardened. Ready to use. Hosted on our servers for 30 days while you test and refine it.

**Every application includes:**
- Automatic security hardening
- Code reviewed for efficiency
- Lightweight, optimised build
- Auto-testing (unit tests and comprehensive test coverage)
- Professional error handling

**Important:** While we build with rigorous quality standards, you should still conduct your own testing before production deployment.

### **Marketing Website**
Professional landing page to promote your application. Downloadable. Customisable. Yours to host.

### **Complete Documentation**
User guides. Technical documentation. Setup instructions. Everything your team needs.

### **All Source Code**
Every line of code. Organised. Commented. Pushed to your GitHub repository. No restrictions.

### **30 Days to Download**
Test your application on our servers. Make sure everything works. Download everything before 30 days.

**After 30 days, we delete it from our servers.**

Why? Because it's yours, not ours. You shouldn't be locked into our hosting. You should own your software completely.

2. **Condenser** – We build the complete blueprint
3. **Mirage** – Visualise and refine your system
4. **Materialiser** – We build it (up to 5 iterations included)
5. **Manifest** – Deploy, test, download everything

**Cost:** $57-77 AUD per application (includes everything)

**Your first 20 credits:** Free ($180 AUD value)

**Important:** We will always tell you before deducting any credits. Work only proceeds after you explicitly approve.

**[See the Detailed Process]** → *How It Works Page*

## WHO THIS IS FOR

### **You're a Small Business Owner**

You know exactly what tool your business needs. You just don't have $50,000 and three months to wait for it.

Thin Air is your technical co-founder in software form.

### **You Run a Small Tech Team**

Your developers are slammed with priority work. But operations needs that dashboard. Marketing needs that lead tracker. Sales needs that portal.

Thin Air is your rapid development team that never sleeps.

### **You Want to Own Your Software**

You're tired of being locked into platforms. You want the code. You want to host it yourself. You want complete control.

Thin Air gives you that. Build it. Download it. Host it anywhere.

## WHY THIN AIR WORKS

### **One Login. Everywhere.**

Already using another Almost Magic application? You're already logged in here.

One account. Credits work across everything. No re-entering details. No separate subscriptions.

### **You Own Everything**

We build it. You download it. You host it wherever you want.

Your code. Your IP. Your data. Your control.

### **Security Built In**

Every application includes:
- Automatic security hardening
- Code review and optimisation
- Comprehensive auto-testing
- Professional error handling
- Lightweight, efficient architecture

**You still test it yourself.** But we've done the heavy lifting.

### **Business-Grade, Not Hobby Projects**

We only accept business email addresses. Why? Because we're building tools for people who mean business.

### **No Lock-In**

After 30 days, your application disappears from our servers. Because you should own your software, not rent it forever.

Download everything. Host anywhere. Keep building.

### **Transparent Before Every Charge**

We always tell you before deducting credits. Every time. You approve first, then we proceed. No surprises.

## AI DISCLAIMER (Footer)

Thin Air uses advanced AI systems to generate code and applications. While we include automatic security hardening, code review, and comprehensive testing, all generated code should be reviewed and tested by you before production deployment. We recommend thorough testing during your 30-day hosting window. Your success is our priority.

---

# PAGE 2: HOW IT WORKS

## PAGE HEADLINE
**From Scattered Thoughts to Deployed Application**

## SUBHEADLINE
This is iterative. You'll review, approve, and refine at each step. Take your time. It's your application—we just handle the technical complexity.

**Timeline:** Typically 5-10 business days from start to deployment, including your review time. However, this depends entirely on how quickly you review and approve. If you move fast, you could potentially complete your entire application in hours.

---

## PHASE 1: VAPOUR

### **Capture Your Idea**

**What you do:**  
Share your idea however it comes out. Talk to us. Sketch it on paper. Upload a PDF specification. Type rambling notes at 2 AM. Whatever works for how you think.

**What happens:**  
We capture everything. Voice becomes text. Sketches become structured information. PDFs get analysed. Context gets understood, not just words recorded.

**What you get:**  
Every scattered thought, organised and ready for you to review. Nothing lost. Everything captured.

**Your effort:**  
Just thinking out loud the way you naturally do.

**Example inputs we accept:**
- Voice notes (any length)
- Hand-drawn sketches (photos or scans)
- PDF specifications
- Typed descriptions
- Email threads
- Existing documentation
- Competitive examples ("build something like X but for Y")

---

## PHASE 2: CONDENSER

### **Build the Blueprint**

**What you do:**  
Review what we've captured. Answer a few clarifying questions to fill any gaps. Approve or adjust whatever needs changing.

**What happens:**  
We create the complete specification for your application—every feature you mentioned *and* the ones you implied but didn't explicitly say. Every entity mapped. Every connection understood. Every edge case considered.

**Before we proceed to building:** We'll tell you exactly how many credits this will cost. If it requires more than initially estimated, we'll explain why and wait for your approval before proceeding.

**What you get:**  
A comprehensive blueprint document you never had to write yourself. This includes:
- Enhanced requirements document
- Feature list (explicit and inferred)
- User flows
- Data relationships
- Integration points
- **Estimated credit cost for this application**

**Review it carefully. Change whatever needs changing.**

**Your effort:**  
Clarifying what you already know. Saying "yes, that's right" or "actually, let's adjust that."

**Time investment:** However long you need. This is your foundation.

---

## PHASE 3: MIRAGE

### **Visualise Your System**

**What you do:**  
Interact with a visual knowledge graph of your entire application. See every entity, feature, and relationship laid out clearly.

Drag elements around. Add features you just thought of. Remove things that don't fit. Rearrange connections. Make it match what's in your head.

**What happens:**  
The visual representation updates in real-time. Want to add user reviews? Add them to the graph. Need payment processing? Connect it. Changed your mind about something? Remove it.

**If you add significant new features:** We'll let you know if this changes the credit cost and wait for your approval before proceeding.

**What you get:**  
Complete control without needing technical knowledge. It's like arranging building blocks, except these blocks become real software.

**Your effort:**  
Playing with the visualisation until it matches your vision. Most people find this part quite satisfying, actually.

**You can:**
- Add new entities
- Remove unnecessary features
- Connect related elements
- See how everything relates
- Spot gaps or redundancies
- Refine the structure

**When you're happy:** Approve it and move forward.

---

## PHASE 4: MATERIALISER

### **We Build It**

**What you do:**  
Approve the final specification. Then we start building.

**What happens:**  
All the complex technical work happens here:
- Code generation
- Database design
- API integration
- **Automatic security hardening**
- **Code review for efficiency**
- **Comprehensive auto-testing (unit tests and more)**
- Error detection and fixing
- Quality assurance
- Performance optimisation

All the things you'd normally pay developers $50,000+ to do over 3-6 months.

**What you get:**  
Production-grade application code. Security-hardened. Tested. Debugged. Lightweight and efficient. Documented. Ready to deploy.

**Your effort:**  
Reviewing what we've built. Testing the functionality. Requesting adjustments if needed.

**Iterations included:** Up to 5 iterations are included in your base cost. We refine based on your feedback until you're satisfied (or until 5 iterations are complete).

**If you need more than 5 iterations:** We'll let you know the additional credit cost and wait for your approval before proceeding.

**This phase includes:**
- Initial build with security hardening
- Your review and feedback (iteration 1)
- Revisions based on your input (up to 4 more iterations)
- Final testing
- Documentation generation

**Important:** Every application includes automatic security hardening, code review for efficiency, lightweight architecture, and comprehensive auto-testing. However, you should still conduct your own testing before production deployment.

---

## PHASE 5: MANIFEST

### **Deploy, Test, Download Everything**

**What you do:**  
Give final approval. We deploy everything to our servers for testing.

**What happens:**

### **During Development (Phase 4)**

Request changes as needed. Up to 5 iterations are included in your base cost.

Common adjustments:
- Feature refinements

- Workflow modifications
- Integration tweaks
- Performance improvements

**Need more than 5 iterations?** We'll let you know the additional credit cost and wait for your approval before proceeding.

### **After Deployment (Phase 5)**

You can still request changes during your 30-day testing window, but these count toward your 5 included iterations.

**If you've used all 5 iterations:**
- Minor adjustments: We'll quote additional credits

# PAGE 4: OUR STORY

## PAGE HEADLINE
**Why We Built This (The Honest Version)**

---

## THE PROBLEM WE LIVED

We got tired of being told "no."

"Sorry, that integration isn't available."  
"You'll need to upgrade for that feature."  
"Custom functionality requires Enterprise."  
"Your data stays on our servers."  
"Want to export? That's an extra $500/month."

Not ideal.

We had ideas. Lots of them. Some brilliant. Some less so. All scattered across voice notes, sketches, and 2 AM epiphanies that never went anywhere because organising them felt like another full-time job.

And the "no-code" tools? They helped sometimes. But mostly they just had different limitations. Different ways of saying "no."

---

## THE REALISATION

Here's what we noticed:

Most business owners and small tech teams don't need "enterprise software." They need specific tools that solve specific problems.

They need:
- That dashboard that saves ops 10 hours weekly
- That client portal that stops the email chaos
- That internal tracker that everyone actually uses
- That marketplace that tests a new revenue stream

They don't need:
- 500 features they'll never use
- Enterprise support packages
- Vendor lock-in
- "Professional services" retainers

They need someone to build the thing. Give them the code. And get out of the way.

That's what Thin Air does.

---

## WHY "THIN AIR"?

Your ideas literally come out of thin air.

A conversation over coffee. A sketch on a whiteboard. A voice note recorded while driving. They're unstructured. Messy. Incomplete.

But they're valuable.

Arthur C. Clarke said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We're not trying to be magical. We're just trying to make the complex feel simple.

Ideas → Requirements → Visual Design → Built Application → Downloaded Code

That should be straightforward. And now it is.

---

## OUR PHILOSOPHY

### **1. You Should Own Your Software**

Not rent it forever. Not get locked into our hosting. Own it. Completely.

That's why we give you 30 days of testing, then delete it from our servers. You download everything. You host wherever you want.

### **2. Credits Should Be Simple**

1 credit = $9 AUD. One app = 6-9 credits. Simple maths.

No "contact us for pricing." No hidden fees. No enterprise sales calls.

**And we always tell you before deducting credits. Every time.**

### **3. Building Should Be Iterative**

You don't know exactly what you want until you see it. That's normal. That's human.

So we build with you. Review. Refine. Adjust. Iterate. Up to 5 iterations included. Until it matches what's in your head.

### **4. Security Should Be Automatic**

Every application gets:
- Automatic security hardening
- Code reviewed for efficiency
- Comprehensive auto-testing
- Lightweight, optimised architecture

You shouldn't have to pay extra for good engineering.

### **5. Documentation Matters**

Every application comes with:
- User guides
- Technical docs
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guides

Because software without documentation is useless.

### **6. Marketing Matters**

Every application gets a marketing website. Why? Because building something is pointless if nobody knows about it.

Even internal tools need adoption. Marketing helps.

## WHO WE ARE

### **Almost Magic Tech Lab**

We're an AI-native consulting firm specialising in AI governance, cybersecurity, and data management—for Australian and New Zealand small-to-medium businesses.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

We built Thin Air because we were frustrated.

Frustrated by tools that promise everything and deliver "sorry, not available."

Frustrated by scattered ideas that never become real.

Frustrated by vendor lock-in and enterprise pricing for simple needs.

Frustrated by surprise charges and hidden fees.

If you're frustrated too, try Thin Air.

Build something. Download it. Own it.

And know exactly what you're paying before we start.

That's the point.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

---

## GETTING STARTED

### **Q: How do I sign up?**

A: Use your business email address. We don't accept personal email addresses (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.).

**Why business emails only?**  
Because we're building tools for businesses, and we want to ensure you're using this professionally.

**[Sign Up Here]** → *20 Free Credits*

---

### **Q: What's a "business email"?**

A: Any email from your company domain.

**Examples:**
- ✓ mani@yourcompany.com.au
- ✓ john@yourbusiness.co
- ✓ sarah@startup.io
- ✗ mani@gmail.com
- ✗ john@yahoo.com

---

### **Q: Is there a free trial?**

A: Better. You get 20 credits ($180 AUD value) when you sign up. Build 2-3 complete applications for free.

**This is our gift so you can experience Thin Air before spending anything.**

No credit card required. No time limit (credits valid 12 months).

---

### **Q: Can I use credits on other Almost Magic products?**

A: Yes! Credits work across all Almost Magic products. One account, multiple tools.

---

## BUILDING APPLICATIONS

### **Q: How long does it take to build an application?**

A: Typically 5-10 business days from start to deployment, including your review time.

**However:** This depends entirely on how quickly you review and approve at each phase.

**If you move fast:** You could potentially complete your entire application in hours.

**Take your time:** The timeline extends based on your review pace. There's no rush.

---

### **Q: What if I don't know exactly what I want?**

A: Perfect. That's what the first three phases are for.

Start with a rough idea. We'll help you clarify it through structured questions, blueprint review, and visual mapping.

**Most people don't know exactly what they want until they see it.** That's normal.

---

### **Q: Can I request changes during development?**

A: Yes! That's the point of the iterative process.

**Up to 5 iterations are included** in your base cost.

**Need more than 5 iterations?** We'll tell you the additional credit cost and wait for your approval before proceeding.

**We always tell you before deducting any credits. You approve first, then we proceed.**

---

### **Q: What if my application is too complex?**

A: We'll tell you during Phase 2 (Condenser).

If your application requires more than 9 credits, we'll let you know and provide options:
1. Simplify the scope to fit within budget
2. Approve additional credits for full scope
3. Break into multiple smaller applications

**No surprises. No hidden costs. You approve before we proceed.**

---

### **Q: Can you build mobile apps?**

A: Currently, Thin Air builds web applications (which work on mobile browsers).

Native mobile apps are coming soon.

**[Join waitlist]** → support@almostmagic.net.au

---

### **Q: What technologies do you use?**

A: We handle all technical decisions. You don't need to know or care about the tech stack.

**Why?** Because you're buying outcomes, not technologies.

**But if you must know:** Modern, production-grade frameworks and languages. Everything is well-documented in the code we give you.

**All applications include:**
- Automatic security hardening
- Code reviewed for efficiency
- Comprehensive auto-testing
- Lightweight architecture

---

## HOSTING & OWNERSHIP

### **Q: Where is my application hosted?**

A: On our servers for 30 days after deployment. After that, you host it wherever you want.

---

### **Q: Why only 30 days of hosting?**

A: Because you should own your software, not rent it forever.

30 days gives you time to:
- Test thoroughly
- Show your team
- Gather feedback
- Request final adjustments (within your 5 iterations)
- Download everything

Then it's yours. Host it anywhere.

---

### **Q: What if I need more than 30 days?**

A: Download everything and host it yourself. We provide deployment instructions for common platforms.

**Extended hosting typically isn't available** because it creates vendor lock-in, which is what we're trying to avoid.

---

### **Q: What happens if I don't download in 30 days?**

A: We delete it from our servers. Gone.

We send multiple reminders:
- Day 20: "10 days left"
- Day 25: "5 days left"
- Day 28: "2 days left"
- Day 29: "24 hours left"
- Day 30: "Last day—download now"

If you miss it, contact support@almostmagic.net.au—we may be able to rebuild from your specification for an additional fee.

---

### **Q: Where should I host my application?**

A: Anywhere you want.

**Popular options:**
- Your own servers
- AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
- Vercel
- On-premises if required

**We provide deployment instructions for common platforms.**

---

### **Q: Do I own the code?**

A: Yes. Completely. Forever.

- Your code
- Your IP
- Your data
- Your control

**We have no ongoing rights to your application.**

---

### **Q: Is the code open source?**

A: Your code is yours. You decide if you want to open source it.

---

## CREDITS & PRICING

---

## COMPARISON QUESTIONS

### **Q: How is Thin Air different from Bubble, Webflow, or other no-code tools?**

A: Three key differences:

1. **You own the code.** Not locked into a platform.
2. **No feature limitations.** Build what you need, not what's available.
3. **No ongoing hosting fees.** Host wherever you want after 30 days.
4. **Automatic security hardening.** Built into every application.

---

### **Q: How is Thin Air different from hiring developers?**

A: **Thin Air:**
- Cost: $57-77 AUD per app
- Time: 5-10 business days (or hours if you approve quickly)
- Outcome: Working application + code + documentation + security + testing

**Hiring developers:**
- Cost: $50,000+ per app
- Time: 3-6 months
- Outcome: Same, but more expensive and slower

**When to hire developers instead:** Complex enterprise systems, highly specialised requirements, ongoing development team needed.

---

### **Q: Can developers review the code quality?**

A: Yes! We encourage it. The code is production-grade, security-hardened, and well-documented.

**Have a technical team member review it during your 30-day testing window.**
